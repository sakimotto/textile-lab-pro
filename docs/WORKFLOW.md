## Core Workflows

### 1. Sample Management Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] -->|Submit Sample| B[Sample Reception]
    B -->|Create Sample Record| C[Sample Database]
    B -->|Generate Sample Code| D[Unique ID]
    B -->|Schedule Tests| E[Calendar]
    C -->|Assign to| F[Technician]
    F -->|Perform Tests| G[Test Results]
    G -->|Generate| H[Test Report]
    H -->|Send to| A
    H -->|Store in| I[Reports Database]
```

### 2. Test Process Flow
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Sample] -->|Schedule| B[Calendar]
    B -->|Assign| C[Technician]
    C -->|Check| D[Equipment Status]
    C -->|Execute| E[Test Procedure]
    E -->|Record| F[Results]
    F -->|Validate| G[Quality Check]
    G -->|Generate| H[Report]
    H -->|Archive| I[Database]
```

### 3. User Roles and Permissions
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Users] --> B[Admin]
    A --> C[Technician]
    A --> D[Manager]
    A --> E[Client]

    B -->|Full Access| F[All Features]
    C -->|Limited to| G[Test Execution]
    C -->|Access to| H[Equipment]
    D -->|View| I[Reports & Analytics]
    D -->|Manage| J[Workflow]
    E -->|View| K[Own Samples]
    E -->|Access| L[Own Reports]
```

## System Components

### 1. Database Schema Relationships
```mermaid
erDiagram
    Client ||--o{ Sample : submits
    Sample ||--o{ Test : undergoes
    Test }|--|| TestMethod : follows
    Test }|--|| Equipment : uses
    Test }|--|| User : performed_by
    Equipment ||--o{ Maintenance : requires
```

### 2. Module Integration
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Authentication] -->|Secure Access| B[Core Application]
    B --> C[Sample Management]
    B --> D[Test Management]
    B --> E[Calendar System]
    B --> F[Equipment Management]
    B --> G[Reporting System]
    
    C -->|Updates| H[Database]
    D -->|Updates| H
    E -->|Reads/Writes| H
    F -->|Updates| H
    G -->|Reads| H
```

## Key Processes

### 1. Sample Submission Process
1. Client submits sample
2. Reception creates sample record
3. System generates unique sample code
4. Tests are scheduled
5. Notifications sent to relevant personnel

### 2. Test Execution Process
1. Technician receives test assignment
2. Equipment status verified
3. Test procedures executed
4. Results recorded
5. Quality check performed
6. Report generated

### 3. Report Generation Process
1. Test results compiled
2. Data validated
3. Report template populated
4. Quality check performed
5. Report approved
6. Client notified
7. Report archived
