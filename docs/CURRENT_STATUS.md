# TextileLab Pro - Current Status and Next Steps

## Current Status - TextileLab Pro

> Last Updated: May 9, 2025 (Updated)

## Architecture Overview

TextileLab Pro has been consolidated to use **Material UI** as the primary UI framework. The application follows a clean architecture with Next.js for routing and React components for the UI.

### Original Design Review Findings
